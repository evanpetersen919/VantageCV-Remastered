"""Scene environment for rendered scenarios: the ground plane plus the sun,
fog and colour grade the UE5 plugin applies (see ``ProceduralScenarioLoader
::ApplyEnvironment``).

Without this the engine template's checkerboard floor and bare desert
hills fill every frame. Values start from Epic's City Sample levels
(height-fog falloff 0.07 and start distance in the hundreds of metres, a
low warm sun, a slightly desaturated grade) and were then tuned by eye
against our own scene, because City Sample's exact values (exposure bias
-1.0, sun temperature 4500K, green-tinted gain) gave a dark teal cast
under our lighting. Every field is a plain number so it can later be
randomized per scenario (time of day, haze) as a domain-randomization
knob.

The ground is a single large quad built through the normal mesh path with
the ``"ground"`` material tag (City Sample's matte parking-lot asphalt,
already migrated), sitting just below the road strips (z=0) so nothing
z-fights. UVs run in metres divided by ``ground_uv_tile_m``.

# Night brightness variety: measured directly against BDD100K's own night images (not

# std of only 1.92 across 318 images (range 15.6-25.0, a 1.6x ratio) against BDD100K
# night's std of 15.73 across a 300-image sample (range 6.9-108.6, a 15.6x ratio) --
# essentially no variety where real photos have a lot. Exposure is a log2 (EV) quantity,
# so a brightness ratio R needs a span of log2(R) stops: BDD's 15.6x ratio needs about 3.97
# stops. The centre is shifted from the previous fixed -3.0 by log2(30.43/19.55) = 0.64
# stops, so the new range's midpoint brightness matches BDD's own mean, not just its
# spread. Both figures come from bin/measure_night_brightness.py.

# overcast, fog, golden-hour, sunset, dawn-haze and night scenario rendered these surfaces with

# parameter names (proven to reach the live material instances by the rain preset already

# al. 2018's own domain-randomization prescription (randomize non-realistically so the network
# can't key on a consistent background appearance) -- centred on, and swinging past, the wet
# preset's own values in both directions, not a narrow "looks realistically dry" range. Puddle-
# specific parameters are deliberately excluded (a puddle with no rain would look like a
# rendering bug, a scene-plausibility concern distinct from the training-signal one this is
