"""Camera poses for rendered frames: an ego-vehicle view and an overview.

The ego view sits on a driving lane's centreline at a typical sensor height and
looks ahead along the lane with a little yaw jitter. Poses are rejected when the
camera would be inside a building or a parked/driving vehicle, or when a
building blocks the view within ``MIN_CLEAR_AHEAD_M``. Given the scenario bounds, a pose is also
rejected when the city's edge lies within ``CLEAR_TO_EDGE_M`` ahead, since the frame would be
mostly the empty horizon beyond the generated area.
