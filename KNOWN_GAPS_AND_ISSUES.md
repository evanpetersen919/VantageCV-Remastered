# Known Gaps, Risks & Open Issues

Living log of everything deferred, unverified, or risky in this implementation,
so nothing gets silently lost between sessions/phases. Update this file whenever
a gap is discovered, deferred, or closed. Never delete a closed entry — mark it
`RESOLVED` with the phase/commit that fixed it.

Severity: **BLOCKER** (must fix before shipping) / **RISK** (works but fragile,
should fix before relying on it) / **DEFERRED** (intentionally postponed to a
later phase, tracked so it isn't forgotten).

Every entry is its own file under [`docs/known_gaps/`](docs/known_gaps/).
