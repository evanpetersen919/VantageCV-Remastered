"""Sphinx configuration for the Synthetic AV Dataset Generator docs.

Implements MASTER_PROMPT Section 3.9's "Complete API documentation
(Sphinx)" bullet. API reference pages are generated via ``autodoc`` +
``napoleon`` directly from this codebase's own docstrings (every module
in ``src/`` already carries full NumPy-style docstrings written during
Phases 1-7, so this configuration mostly just needs to point Sphinx at
them, not write new documentation content from scratch).
