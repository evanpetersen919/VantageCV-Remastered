# Experiment Log — Sim-to-Real Detection Transfer

Tracks every synthetic-data training run for the train-synthetic/test-real experiment: what
changed, why, and what happened on the real benchmarks (BDD100K val, 10,000 images; Cityscapes
val, 500 images). Each entry is written after the run's evaluation completes, not before —
numbers here are always measured, never predicted.

All arms use YOLOv10m, imgsz 960, eval settings `--conf 0.001 --iou 0.6 --max-det 100`.
"Scratch" = trained from `yolov10m.yaml` for 200 epochs. "Fine-tune" = trained from COCO
weights (`yolov10m.pt`) for 50 epochs. Real-control = 1,838 real BDD100K training images,
equal size to the synthetic training set, trained the same way as scratch — the fair
same-data-volume reference point.

The entries are in order of when they were run, one file each under [`docs/experiments/`](docs/experiments/); each is written after its evaluation completes.
