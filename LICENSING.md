# Licensing record

What each asset class in VantageCV comes from, what its licence says (quoted where the text was read),
what is settled, and what is not. This is a record of evidence, **not legal advice**. Updated 2026-10-13 (research pass added).
Dated working notes and results are in [`EXPERIMENT_LOG.md`](EXPERIMENT_LOG.md).

## Summary

| Asset class | Source and licence | Status for training a detector on renders | Used in |
|---|---|---|---|
| This repository's code | MIT ([`LICENSE`](LICENSE)) | Settled | everything |
| Unreal Engine 5.4 | Unreal Engine EULA | Engine use settled; see crowd row for the one clause that concerns training | rendering |
| City Sample vehicles, buildings, road kit, props | Epic Content License Agreement and Fab Standard License (EULA text read, 16(l) on 2026-10-13 via a text renderer); Fab page tag "Allows usage with AI: No" | **Open.** Text read as limited to generative AI; Epic has not confirmed | all batches |
| City Sample crowd characters (adapted from MetaHumans) | Unreal Engine EULA, MetaHuman clause | **Unresolved.** Not limited to generative AI. **Not used in new work since 2026-10-08** | batches up to `train_v12e` |
| Megascans / Quixel items in the project (curbs, bollards, hydrants, barriers, street furniture) | Governed by the same two agreements as City Sample: Fab Standard License (Fab EULA) and, for legacy Epic-era items, the Epic Content License Agreement; no Megascans-specific AI clause found | Same status as City Sample (NoAI wording is generative-only; Epic unconfirmed) | all batches |
| Vehicle Variety Pack Vol. 2 box truck (Fab) | Fab Standard License; "Allows usage with AI: No" | Same reading as City Sample vehicles; unconfirmed | only the `v11` truck experiment |
| Rocketbox avatars (pedestrians in new work) | MIT since 2020-11-16 (earlier: Microsoft Research License) | Permissive text with a relicensing history; MIT does not name ML training; counsel question | `train_v13r` |
| BDD100K (25% of every arm's training images; all evaluation) | UC Regents licence: free for educational, research and not-for-profit use; commercial use only for BDD/BAIR Commons members (text read from a mirror) | Research use fine; **commercial use of anything trained on it needs a separate licence** | training, evaluation |
| Cityscapes (evaluation only) | Non-commercial; abstract derivatives such as trained models may be distributed (official page read) | Fine for evaluation; no Cityscapes data in anything published | evaluation |
| RealDriveSim (comparison arms only) | CC BY 4.0 (official project page read) | Fine with attribution; not part of any release | comparison arms |
| KITTI (statistics, ring table and split lists derived from it; no KITTI data committed) | CC BY-NC-SA 3.0 plus "academic use only" (official page, 2026-10-13) | **Open.** Whether measured statistics and the split lists are adaptations under the licence or fall under EU database rights; nothing was shipped as KITTI data | LiDAR study, `configs/kitti_*` |
| ultralytics (YOLO training code) | AGPL-3.0 (LICENSE file read); Ultralytics states trained models are AGPL-3.0 too unless an Enterprise License is bought | **A blocker for releasing weights under a non-AGPL licence**; the repository code that imports it is also affected | training |

**Published so far:** MIT code, rendered images and videos, results and this log. **Not published:** datasets and trained
weights. **Goal (owner, 2026-10-08): publish the dataset on Kaggle; trained weights are not going to be published.** What that
requires is in the section "Publishing the dataset on Kaggle" below; the weights-only rows (ultralytics, BDD100K's commercial
restriction) stop mattering for a dataset-only release.

## Research pass of 2026-10-13 (four parallel reads; not legal advice)

Sources are named per item; "renderer" means a third-party text renderer of a JavaScript page (Epic's own pages return HTTP
403 to automated fetches), so the quotes below should be re-read in a browser before anything relies on them.

**1. Fab EULA Section 16(l) is read, and it carves out classifiers.** From `fab.com/eula`, header "Last updated: October 1st,
2024" (renderer): "Content that is tagged with "NoAI" in the Epic Marketplace at the time of your Transaction is "NoAI
Content." Under a Standard License, you may not use NoAI Content (a) in datasets utilized by Generative AI Programs, (b) in the
development of Generative AI Programs, or (c) as training inputs to Generative AI Programs." ... ""Generative AI Programs" means
artificial intelligence, machine learning, deep learning, neural networks, or similar technologies designed to automate the
generation of or aid in the creation of new content, including but not limited to audio, visual, or text-based content. Programs
do not meet this definition of Generative AI Programs where they, by non-limiting example, (a) solely operate on the original
content; (b) generate tags to classify visual input content; or (c) generate instructions to arrange existing content, without
creating new content." Reading: an object detector produces tags and boxes and creates no content, so it fits (b). The list is
"by non-limiting example", and Epic has not confirmed it.

**Confirmed from the live page by the owner, 2026-10-13.** The owner read `fab.com/eula` in a browser (header "Last updated:
October 1st, 2024") and pasted Section 16(l)(i); it matches the quote above word for word, including "Programs do not meet this
definition of Generative AI Programs where they, by non-limiting example, (a) solely operate on the original content; (b)
generate tags to classify visual input content; or (c) generate instructions to arrange existing content, without creating new
content." Two points of wording to keep in view: the NoAI status is fixed by the tag "at the time of your Transaction", and the
restriction is on use "in datasets utilized by Generative AI Programs", so a release should carry a term barring that use.

**2. Content License Agreement Section 17** (fetched from `unrealengine.com/en-US/eula/content`) has the same purpose-limited
definition **without** the carve-out examples. Differences that matter: CLA Section 16(b) says amended terms apply to Licensed
Content "that you downloaded under any prior version of this Agreement" (Fab Section 7(a) keeps the terms at acquisition), and Fab
16(l) ties NoAI status to the tag "at the time of your Transaction". Whether City Sample was tagged when it was acquired, and
under which agreement it came, is not recorded.

**3. Epic's own statements on the tag.** Fab developer documentation: "The NoAI meta tag indicates that an asset must not be used
for generative AI data collection." Staff announcement of 2023-02-20 (forum, summarised): the tag "signals to generative AI
programs that the product is not for generative AI data collection". No Epic statement on object detection, perception or
simulation datasets was found.

**4. Non-image outputs are open.** Fab 4(b) and CLA 3(b) allow distributing "images created using Content" and rendered linear
media; depth maps, class maps, masks, exact 3D boxes and LiDAR point clouds are not named. Fab 6(b)(i) also bars attempts to
"derive source code or data from the Content", which Epic could read against geometry-derived labels (inference).

**5. Unreal Engine EULA.** An older undated PDF allows royalty-free distribution of "rendered video files ... or images created
using the Engine Code" and requires a credits notice ("Unreal Engine, Copyright 1998 - xxxx, Epic Games, Inc. All rights
reserved."). Epic's change log (secondary) describes a later update adding a ban on using the Licensed Technology "as a training
input or prompt-based input into any Generative AI Program". The current EULA text was not read.

**6. KITTI** (`cvlibs.net/datasets/kitti`, read 2026-10-13): all datasets "published under the Creative Commons
Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 3.0" licence, and the privacy section says "This dataset is made available for academic use
only." Committed in this repository and derived from KITTI: `configs/kitti_derived_constants.json` (range caps, car-length
percentile, pedestrian box size, class and range intensity histograms), `configs/kitti_beam_pattern.json` (ring elevations,
per-ring fill), `configs/kitti_splits/train.txt` and `val.txt` (the standard split lists). No KITTI images or point clouds are
committed. CC's own guidance: "Facts are not subject to copyright" and, for the 3.0 licences, "CC 3.0 license conditions do not
apply to uses of data and databases that do not implicate copyright"; the licence text says nothing on database rights, and
KITTI is a German (KIT) dataset, so sui generis database rights are a separate question. Virtual KITTI, which clones KITTI
sequences, describes itself as "an Adaptation of the KITTI Vision Benchmark Suite" under the same licence. Risk by item: the
format conventions (velodyne `.bin`, `label_2`, `calib`) low; the ring table low; the intensity histograms the closest to a
derived data product; the split lists are KITTI's own selection, shipped in an MIT repository, and are easy to fetch instead.

**7. Rocketbox** (`microsoft/Microsoft-Rocketbox`, read 2026-10-13). `LICENSE.md` is the standard MIT licence with no mention of
ML. The GitHub API lists four commits for it: `a5ab3d5` and `ec8c809` (2020-03-13), `4a3f2c0` and `accbe42` (2020-11-17 01:00
UTC, which is 2020-11-16 Pacific); commit `1eeb280`, cited earlier in this record, was not seen. Issue #24 (2026-08-01, no
maintainer reply) asks whether the animation files fall under the MIT licence. No per-asset or photo-subject provenance is
documented (the paper says textures came from "photographs of real people" that were "mixed and strongly modified").
Microsoft's own wording stayed "free research and academic use". The WACV 2024 paper cited above (arXiv 2208.12763) is
"Leveraging Synthetic Data to Learn Video Stabilization Under Adverse Conditions" (Kerim et al.); it names Rocketbox as its
character library and states no licence for it.

**8. Tools and CC0 sources.** Blender: its licence page says "What you create with Blender is your sole property" and its FAQ
that its output "is considered program output, and the sole copyright of the user"; the GPL FAQ agrees, so the baked poses
inherit Rocketbox's status, not the GPL. ambientCG and Poly Haven are CC0; Poly Haven states it is "still OK with people using
our assets to train their AIs" (its Terms of Service separately bar scraping). ultralytics' own licence page (read): "All
Ultralytics YOLO trained models fall under the AGPL-3.0 License by default"; only relevant if weights are published. OpenPCDet is
Apache-2.0.

**9. Kaggle and alternatives** (Kaggle pages read through a renderer). Terms: "you represent and warrant you have all rights
necessary"; the acceptable-use policy lists uploading data that violates others' intellectual property; Section 9 grants "all
other users" a licence to public submissions as the functionality allows; Kaggle may remove content on an allegation, and the
uploader indemnifies Kaggle. The licence list has "Other (specified in description)", and custom terms live in the description
only; no enforcement mechanism was found and no NoAI-specific rule. Hugging Face (gated datasets, `license: other` with a LICENSE
file) and Zenodo (restricted access per requester, DOI, "non-military purposes only") are alternatives with explicit acceptance
steps. Precedent: UrbanSyn adds a clause prohibiting "the use of generative AI technologies for reverse engineering any assets or
creating content for stock media platforms"; MatrixCity (UE 5.0.3 on City Sample) is released CC BY-NC 4.0 with no NoAI note;
Virtual KITTI and SYNTHIA are CC BY-NC-SA 3.0; the RAIL family uses a flow-down use restriction.

**10. Draft wording, for counsel to confirm (not advice).** "This dataset may be used, copied and redistributed with attribution.
Use for research and development of models that do not generate new content (for example detection, segmentation, depth,
tracking, LiDAR perception) is permitted. You may not use this dataset, or any part of it, to train, fine-tune or develop, or
supply as input to, any generative AI program, meaning AI designed to automate the generation of or aid in the creation of new
content. You must include this condition in any redistribution. Underlying third-party assets remain subject to their own
licences and no right in them is granted."

**Addendum, same day: three items settled by reading.**

- **Current Unreal Engine EULA** (`unrealengine.com/en-US/eula/unreal`, fetched with a browser user agent, 58,000 characters
  of text). The generative-AI clause concerns the engine: among the things you may not do is "result in using the Licensed
  Technology as a training input to any Generative AI Program or as prompt-based input where the Generative AI Program trains
  on input data", with "Generative AI Program" defined as technologies "designed to automate the generation of or aid in the
  creation of new content". It is about the engine code, not rendered output, and not about a detector. The same list holds
  the MetaHuman clause quoted earlier ("or any rendered output thereof if crafted to replicate the functionality of MetaHuman").
  The credits clause is conditional: "If a Product you develop under this Agreement has credits, you must place the following
  notices in the credits" ("[Product name] uses Unreal Engine. Unreal is a trademark or registered trademark of Epic Games,
  Inc. in the United States of America and elsewhere." and "Unreal Engine, Copyright 1998 - xxxx, Epic Games, Inc. All rights
  reserved."); including both in a dataset card costs nothing.
- **Content License Agreement, distribution items.** Section 3(b) (fetched from `unrealengine.com/en-US/eula/content`): "You may
  freely Distribute Licensed Content incorporated into rendered linear media products. This means, for example, you may freely
  Distribute rendered video files ... or images created using Licensed Content." The restrictions in Section 5 include: "vii.
  except where explicitly allowed by this Agreement, collect, aggregate, mine, scrape, or otherwise use any Licensed Content for
  the purposes of publishing, selling, distributing or otherwise making the content available to others to use, download or
  copy; viii. collect, aggregate, mine, scrape or otherwise use NoAI Content (i) in datasets utilized by Generative AI Programs;
  ...". Consequence: images are explicitly allowed; point clouds and other geometry-derived data are not named, and item vii is
  the clause that would bite if they were read as "making the content available". This is the strongest reason to treat
  LiDAR as a separate, later question.
- **BDD100K data licence** (the project's own documentation source,
  `raw.githubusercontent.com/bdd100k/bdd100k/master/doc/source/license.rst`; the official hosts still fail): "The data and
  labels downloaded from https://bdd-data.berkeley.edu/ are under the License below. Copyright 2018. The Regents of the
  University of California ... Permission to use, copy, modify, and distribute this software and its documentation for
  educational, research, and not-for-profit purposes, without fee and without a signed licensing agreement; and permission to
  use, copy, modify and distribute this software for commercial purposes (such rights not subject to transfer) to BDD and BAIR
  Commons members and their affiliates, is hereby granted, provided that the above copyright notice, this paragraph and the
  following two paragraphs appear in all copies, modifications, and distributions." This matches the mirror text recorded
  below. No data is shipped.
- **What the local Fab cache can and cannot say** (`VaultCache/FabLibrary/listings_v1.db`, read 2026-10-13): City Sample and the
  Vehicle Variety Pack read `is_ai_forbidden` = 1; the listings' publish times are 2026-08-27 and 2026-07-20; the cache has no
  acquisition date and no tag history (`created_at` and `downloaded_at` are empty or 0). The date you added City Sample, and
  whether it carried the tag then, has to come from the Fab library ("Added" date) or the Epic account's purchase history.

**Published precedent and community readings found on 2026-10-13 (confirmation search; none of it is an Epic ruling).**

- **Meta's PUG dataset** (NeurIPS 2023, rendered in Unreal Engine from Unreal Marketplace and Sketchfab assets). Its GitHub
  README: "The datasets are distributed under the CC-BY-NC, with the addenda that they should not be used to train Generative AI
  models." The paper's datasheet says the assets belong to external sources and points to Epic's terms ("See EpicGames"). This
  is the closest published precedent for the terms drafted above: a non-commercial licence plus an explicit no-generative-AI
  addendum, on a dataset made of Epic-ecosystem renders. No Epic objection was found (absence of evidence).
- **MatrixCity** (ICCV 2023), built with "the Unreal Engine 5 City Sample project": its project page says "copyright by us and
  published under the Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial 4.0 International License", with no mention of Epic's terms.
  Publicly released; no objection found.
- **Epic Developer Community thread, July 2024** ("Unreal Engine Marketplace Licenses Question"): a researcher planning to
  publish extracted frames and text annotations for non-commercial research, with the same reading of the NoAI wording as
  recorded here ("What i am trying to do is Predictive AI (not Generative)"). Marketplace support replied, as the poster
  reports, that they "are not able to provide legal clarifications for specific use cases"; no Epic staff post in the thread.
  This matches Epic's reply to this project (2026-10-08).
- **Epic's own description of the tag** (Fab developer documentation, quoted earlier): "The NoAI meta tag indicates that an asset
  must not be used for generative AI data collection"; the Publisher Portal control is worded "Disallow use by generative AI".
- **Unreal Engine EULA thread, October 2024** ("NEW EULA AI Restriction?"): community members only, divided between a broad and
  a narrow reading of the engine clause; no Epic staff reply; nothing on detectors or synthetic data.
- **KITTI split lists in other repositories:** `charlesq34/frustum-pointnets` carries `kitti/image_sets/{train,val,trainval,test}.txt`
  (listing seen; the repository's licence was not visible on the page). Common practice, not a legal confirmation.
- **Creative Commons guidance** ("Using CC-licensed works for AI training"): the BY, SA and ND conditions "are triggered only when
  works or adaptations of works are publicly shared"; the NC condition applies to "all uses requiring permission under copyright".
  The page does not address statistics or facts extracted from a licensed dataset.
- **Rocketbox:** no dataset built from it and licensed with ML terms was found; the repository README says "The library of
  avatars is now released under MIT License" (12/2020).

Net: the clause text, Epic's own description of the tag and two published Unreal-based datasets all point the same way (a
detector dataset with a no-generative-AI term). Nothing found is an authoritative confirmation, and nothing found contradicts it.

**Questions for counsel, after this pass**
1. Do depth, class, mask, 3D-box and LiDAR outputs fall inside the distribution right for "images created using Content", or are
   they derived data under Fab 6(b)(i)?
2. Does a detector clearly fall within the carve-outs of Fab 16(l), and does the CLA's lack of those examples change the answer
   for content that came through the CLA?
3. Which agreement governs City Sample as acquired, was it tagged at acquisition, and did accepting amended terms pull it under
   CLA Section 17?
4. Exposure if a third party trains a generative model on the published dataset despite a terms-of-use prohibition; does Kaggle's
   Section 9 grant to other users conflict with a description-only licence?
5. Rocketbox: does the MIT relicence cover every mesh, texture and animation given the research-only history and issue #24; does
   MIT's "use" include ML training; do rendered avatars trigger the notice condition?
6. KITTI: are measured statistics, the ring table and the split lists adaptations or extractions under CC BY-NC-SA 3.0 and EU
   database law; does "academic use only" bind beyond the licence; may a dataset matched to KITTI be released under non-NC terms?
7. Unreal Engine EULA: the current text on generative-AI training input and on credits for a dataset.
8. BDD100K: the official terms (both official hosts failed on 2026-10-13: DNS error and an invalid certificate).

## Epic content (City Sample, Unreal Engine)

Clause texts below were copied from Epic's pages by the repository owner on 2026-10-05; the pages themselves could not be fetched
by the tooling used here (HTTP 403), so re-check them on the live pages before relying on them.

**Content License Agreement** (<https://www.unrealengine.com/eula/content>)

- Section 3b, Linear Media: "You may freely Distribute Licensed Content incorporated into rendered linear media products. This means,
  for example, you may freely Distribute rendered video files (e.g., broadcast or streamed video files, cartoons, or movies) or images
  created using Licensed Content." Reading: publishing renders, images and videos is allowed.
- Section 17, Artificial Intelligence: "Any Licensed Content that has been tagged ... 'NoAI' ... will be known as 'NoAI Content.' ...
  'Generative AI Programs' means artificial intelligence, machine learning, deep learning, neural networks, or similar technologies
  designed to automate the generation of or aid in the creation of new content ... You shall not collect, aggregate, mine, scrape, or
  otherwise use NoAI Content (i) in datasets utilized by Generative AI Programs; (ii) in the development of Generative AI Programs; or
  (iii) as inputs to Generative AI Programs." Reading, **unconfirmed by Epic**: the restriction is on generative programs; an object
  detector generates nothing. A published dataset could be used by others for generative AI, so any dataset release would carry a
  "no generative AI use" notice.

**Fab page for City Sample:** "License terms: Standard License ... Allows usage with AI: No", treated as the NoAI tag. The question
sent to Epic (below) asked what it means for training a detector.

**Unreal Engine EULA, General Restrictions:** the Generative AI restriction is limited to generative programs. The MetaHuman
clause is not: "use, or permit others to use, MetaHuman digital characters and animation curves (or any rendered output thereof if
crafted to replicate the functionality of MetaHuman) to build or enhance any database or training or testing any artificial
intelligence, machine learning, deep learning, neural networks, or similar technologies."

**City Sample crowd provenance:** Epic's City Sample documentation (quoted by a research pass; verify on the live page): "The City
Sample is populated with thousands of unique digital human characters adapted from a subset of MetaHumans and accessories." In the
project files the crowd characters reference MetaHuman skeleton, skin, eye and hair assets. Verdict recorded 2026-10-05: derived
from MetaHuman with high confidence on provenance, low confidence on the clause's legal reach.

**Correspondence.** Asked Epic on 2026-10-05 (Unreal Engine licensing contact form): do the crowd characters count as MetaHuman for
this clause; does it prohibit training a non-generative detector on such renders, evaluated only on real photographs; may renders,
a labelled dataset and trained weights be published. Reply received 2026-10-08, in full: "Unfortunately, we're not able to provide
custom legal or EULA interpretations for specific developer distribution models. For questions regarding how the Unreal Engine EULA
applies to your specific product and distribution plans, we'd recommend consulting with your own legal counsel." No yes and no no.

**Decision (2026-10-08):** no MetaHuman-derived pedestrians in new datasets, experiments or releases; Rocketbox only. The
`pedestrian_source: city_sample` option remains only to reproduce earlier batches and logs a warning when used.

## Fab End User License Agreement (Standard License)

The Fab page for City Sample (and for third-party Fab content such as the Vehicle Variety Pack) names the Standard License. Text
pasted by the repository owner on 2026-10-08 from Epic's page (summary header: "Last updated: October 1st, 2024"). The pasted text
stops at Section 16(g); Section 16(l), which Section 6 points to for the definitions of "NoAI Content" and "Generative AI
Programs", was **not** in the paste and has not been read.

- Section 3(a), Standard License: "a non-exclusive and non-transferable license to privately use, reproduce, display, perform, and
  modify the Content in accordance with the terms of this Agreement ... you can privately use the Content however you want under a
  Standard License." Private research use is inside the grant, subject to the restrictions below.
- Section 4(b), Distributing Linear Media Projects: "Subject to any applicable restrictions in Section 6 (Content Use Restrictions),
  you may freely Distribute a Project that is a rendered linear media product. This means, for example, you may freely Distribute:
  i. rendered video files (e.g., broadcast or streamed video files, cartoons, movies, or images) and ii. images created using
  Content." Reading: publishing rendered images and videos is allowed; whether a labelled image dataset counts as "images created
  using Content" is a reading, not stated.
- Section 6(b)(vii), General Restrictions: "you may not: ... use NoAI Content (i) in datasets utilized by Generative AI Programs; (ii)
  in the development of Generative AI Programs; or (iii) as training inputs to Generative AI Programs. See Section 16(l) for the
  definitions of NoAI Content and Generative AI Programs." Same structure as Content License Agreement Section 17 (above): the
  restriction is worded around Generative AI Programs. The definition that decides whether a detector is one is in 16(l), unread.
- Section 7(a), Amendments: "Any Content you acquired (whether free or paid) prior to the modified terms will remain governed by the
  license terms applicable at the time when you acquired the Content." The terms that apply are those at the time of acquisition;
  acquisition dates of City Sample and of the Vehicle Variety Pack should be recorded (not yet).
- Section 14(b), Indemnification: the user indemnifies the Content Licensor against third-party claims "related to your Project or
  your exercise of a license granted to you". A liability point for counsel.
- Section 6(a), Non-Compatible Licenses: Standard License content may not be combined with code or content under a licence (for
  example GPL, LGPL, CC BY-SA) that would require the Content to be governed by other terms. Nothing in this repository combines
  Content with such code (renders and labels are separate files); noted for counsel together with the ultralytics licence (unchecked).

## Publishing the dataset on Kaggle

Scope: rendered images and their labels (COCO, YOLO, KITTI, masks) of a Rocketbox batch, with a README. No weights, no BDD100K,
Cityscapes or RealDriveSim data, no Epic asset files, no ultralytics code (link to the GitHub repository instead).

**Which batches.** Only batches rendered with `pedestrian_source: rocketbox` (`train_v13r` and later). Never the batches with the
City Sample crowd (`train_v7p`, `train_v12e` and earlier): their renders contain MetaHuman-derived characters, and the EULA clause
covers "any rendered output thereof". Checked 2026-10-08 on all 256 scenarios of `urban_dense_v13r.yaml`: 6,343,451 asset entries,
by folder `/Game/Building` 5,295,020, `/Game/Vehicle` 1,151,193, `/Game/Megascans` 346,712, `/Game/Road` 282,419, `/Game/Prop` 249,340,
`/Game/VantageCV` (this project's own, including the Rocketbox meshes) 81,863; **none under `/Crowd` or with MetaHuman in the path**.
The test level holds no resident crowd (frames rendered with no scenario pedestrians show none).

**What the texts say about a dataset of renders** (readings, not legal advice):
- Distributing renders: Content License Agreement Section 3b and Fab EULA Section 4(b) allow freely distributing "images created
  using Content", subject to the Content Use Restrictions (Section 6). Rocketbox's MIT grant includes the right to "publish,
  distribute" (a copy of the notice must accompany copies of the avatars themselves; renders are not copies, but the notice is
  cheap to include).
- The clause that touches a dataset: CLA Section 17 and Fab EULA Section 6(b)(vii) bar using NoAI Content "in datasets utilized by
  Generative AI Programs". City Sample is NoAI-tagged. A detector is not a generative program, but a public dataset can be
  downloaded by anyone, including people training generative models. Whether that puts the publisher in breach is not stated;
  the cautious course is terms that forbid generative-AI use of the dataset. **Counsel question.**
- Licence choice on Kaggle: the Creative Commons and ODbL options cannot add a ban on generative-AI use (their terms forbid extra
  restrictions), and a share-alike licence (CC BY-SA, GPL-like) collides with Fab Section 6(a), which names CC BY-SA as
  incompatible with Standard License content. The natural fit is Kaggle's "Other (specified in description)" with explicit terms:
  attribution; research and development of non-generative models allowed; no use to train, develop or feed generative AI programs;
  no redistribution of Epic assets (none are included); third-party notices below. CC0 is not suitable. Wording to be confirmed
  by counsel.
- Notices to carry in the dataset README: City Sample and Unreal Engine are Epic Games, Inc.'s; Microsoft Rocketbox avatars,
  MIT, Copyright (c) 2020 Microsoft, with the licence text; a statement that no real-world data is included.

**Still open for a dataset release**
1. The NoAI/dataset point above (Epic's reading of Section 17 / 16(l), unread and unconfirmed).
2. Megascans items (curbs, street furniture; 5.5% of the scenario asset entries) fall under the same agreements as City Sample
   (see above), so they share point 1 and need nothing further of their own.
3. Rocketbox: MIT's silence on ML and the research-only release history (counsel); for an image dataset the avatars are rendered
   pixels, not distributed files, which lowers but does not remove the question.
4. The Kaggle licence wording itself, and Kaggle's own terms for uploads containing third-party content.

**No longer in play with a dataset-only release:** ultralytics/AGPL for weights, and BDD100K's commercial-use restriction for
trained models (only metrics computed with them would appear, and no BDD100K data is shipped). The AGPL and BDD100K notes above
become relevant again if weights are ever published.

## Vegetation textures and models (CC0)

Added 2026-10-10 for the leafy street trees, the curb grass and the scanned trees. Everything here is under Creative Commons CC0 1.0
(public domain dedication), which allows copying, modifying and redistributing, even commercially, with no permission or attribution.
CC0 is also compatible with the dataset terms discussed above (it adds nothing to the restrictions on the Epic content).

Pillow and numpy have no third-party origin and were replaced by the photographs above.

## Pedestrians in new work: Microsoft Rocketbox

- Repository `microsoft/Microsoft-Rocketbox` (115 rigged avatars; 38 adult avatars used). Current `LICENSE.md`: the standard MIT
  License, "Copyright (c) 2020 Microsoft", no added terms, no mention of machine learning.
- History (from the repository's git log): created 2020-03-13 with the **Microsoft Research License Terms**, granting use "for
  non-commercial, non-revenue generating, research purposes" and forbidding distribution of the Dataset. On 2020-11-16 (commits
  `4a3f2c0`, `accbe42` per the GitHub API listing of 2026-10-13; `1eeb280` was not seen) the paper's first author replaced it with the MIT License. The repository was archived 2026-10-02.
- Paper (Gonzalez-Franco et al., Frontiers in Virtual Reality, 2020-11-03, DOI 10.3389/frvir.2020.561558, 13 days before the
  relicensing): the library is "publicly available for research and academic use".
- Prior use by others: Kerim et al., WACV 2024 (arXiv 2208.12763), Section 4, uses "The Microsoft Rocketbox Avatar Library" for
  character avatars in a synthetic-data simulator and releases the simulator and datasets. It states no licence terms.
- Scan of the local clone (the avatars and animations used; `Assets/Avatars/Adults` and `Assets/Animations`): the only licence or
  notice files are the repository's `LICENSE.md` (MIT) and `README.md`; no per-asset or third-party notices were found there.
- Open for counsel: MIT does not name ML training; whether the later MIT grant covers every mesh and texture given the earlier
  research-only release and the paper's wording.

## Other City Sample-adjacent content

- **Fab library record (read 2026-10-08 from the launcher's local cache, `VaultCache/FabLibrary/listings_v1.db`):** the library holds
  three listings: *City Sample* (Epic Games, `is_ai_forbidden` = 1), *Vehicle Variety Pack Volume 2* (Switchboard Studios,
  `is_ai_forbidden` = 1) and *Stylized House Interior* (`is_ai_forbidden` = 0; no content from it is in the project). An earlier
  note that the Vehicle Variety Pack read 0 is superseded: the cache now reads 1, matching its page. Launcher download folders
  (file creation dates, a proxy for acquisition, not the licence acceptance date): `CitySample_5.7` 2025-12-27,
  `VehicleVc016a8147616V2` 2025-12-30, `CitySample_5.4` 2026-09-16. The exact acceptance dates are in the Epic account's purchase
  history (not read).
- **Megascans / Quixel** (the project's `Content/Megascans`: bollards, barriers, hydrants, mailboxes, plant pots, garbage cans,
  `Modular_Curb_5_M`, parking meter, signs; the scenes use curbs, hydrants, a parking meter and a road sign, from
  `road_edge_kit.py` and `street_furniture.py`). Checked 2026-10-08:
  - `quixel.com/terms` permanently redirects (HTTP 308) to Epic's Content License Agreement (`unrealengine.com/eula/content`).
  - Quixel's licence page says: "Assets bought on Fab are available under the Fab Standard License" (linked to the Fab EULA), and
    offers custom project or studio licences; it says nothing on AI.
  - Epic staff on the forum (2024-10-23, thread "Megascans License?"): Megascans obtained from Fab are under "the new license"
    (Fab Standard); items acquired earlier under Unreal Unlimited "remain subject to the Content EULA and will be considered
    UE-only content". Community members asked for confirmation on other points and got no staff answer.
  - The Fab library cache has no separate Megascans listing, so these items came inside the City Sample package (whose listing is
    flagged AI-forbidden).
  Result: Megascans here fall under the same two agreements already recorded (Fab EULA Sections 3, 4, 6; Content License
  Agreement Sections 3, 17), with the same distribution allowance for rendered images and the same NoAI wording. No
  Megascans-specific restriction on AI or datasets was found anywhere; none of these pages was available verbatim (Epic's pages return
  403), so the owner's paste of Fab Section 16 and the account's licence record remain the missing pieces. This is not a separate
  open question any more.
- **Vehicle Variety Pack Vol. 2** (Fab, free; one box truck): Standard License, "Allows usage with AI: No", "Generated with AI:
  No". Used only in the `v11` experiment; later batches use City Sample vehicles. Same reading and status as City Sample's vehicles.

## Epic clauses: second sources and what could not be read

Epic's own pages (`unrealengine.com/eula/...`, `fab.com/eula`) refuse automated fetches (HTTP 403) and web archives are blocked
for the tooling used, so the quotes above rest on the owner's paste. Corroboration found on 2026-10-08:

- MetaHuman clause: a third-party mirror (ConductAtlas, version CA-V-001373, first captured 2026-05-05) quotes "use, or permit others
  to use, MetaHuman digital characters and animation curves ... to build or enhance any database or training ...", matching the
  owner's paste; CGChannel (2025-06-04) reports that under Epic's new licensing MetaHumans may be used "in workflows that
  incorporate artificial intelligence technology" but "not to train or enhance the AI models themselves". The restriction on
  training is therefore not limited to generative AI, and dates from June 2025 or earlier.
- Content License Agreement Section 17: Epic's change log (search snippet only) describes it as new, prohibiting NoAI content in
  datasets for, in the development of, or as inputs to Generative AI Programs, matching the owner's paste.
- Fab EULA Section 6(b)(vii) points to Section 16(l) for the definitions of NoAI Content and Generative AI Programs. A forum post
  (Epic Developer Community, "AI image use") quotes a different Fab paragraph (when content counts as created with Generative AI
  Programs), not the NoAI definition. **16(l) was read on 2026-10-13 (research pass above); this paragraph is kept as the earlier record.** If it matches Content License Agreement Section 17's
  definition ("designed to automate the generation of or aid in the creation of new content"), a detector is outside it; that is
  an inference until the text is read.

## Evaluation and training data

- **BDD100K** (25% of every arm's real training images, plus all evaluation). The code repository's `LICENSE` is BSD 3-Clause
  (Copyright 2018 Fisher Yu); the data carry a different licence. A mirror of the dataset (Hugging Face `dgural/bdd100k`)
  reproduces it: "Copyright (c) 2018. The Regents of the University of California (Regents). All Rights Reserved."; permission to
  "use, copy, modify, and distribute this software and its documentation for educational, research, and not-for-profit purposes"
  without fee; a separate grant for "commercial purposes (such rights not subject to transfer)" to "BDD and BAIR Commons members and
  their affiliates"; commercial enquiries to UC Berkeley's Office of Technology Licensing. The official site (`doc.bdd100k.com`)
  could not be reached, so this is read from a mirror and should be confirmed on the official page. Meaning for this project:
  research use is inside the grant; weights trained on BDD100K images, if released for commercial use by others, raise a question
  for counsel.
- **Cityscapes** (evaluation only, never trained on). Official page, read 2026-10-08: freely available "for non-commercial
  purposes"; no use of the dataset or a derivative work for commercial purposes; "That you do not distribute this dataset or
  modified versions"; "It is permissible to distribute derivative works in as far as they are abstract representations of this
  dataset" (trained models are the page's own example); attribution required; Terms of Use Section 3.2 limits access to registered
  users affiliated with scientific bodies and Section 4.2 limits making contents available to third parties. Nothing published here
  contains Cityscapes data; scores and per-class numbers are results.
- **RealDriveSim** (512 images in two comparison arms; not part of any release). Official project page, read 2026-10-08: "Licensed
  under CC BY 4.0". Sharing anything derived from it needs attribution (Jadon et al., 2025, arXiv 2506.16319); the repository keeps
  its files in the git-ignored `external_data/`.
- **ultralytics** (YOLO training and scoring). The repository `LICENSE` is the GNU Affero General Public License v3 (19 November
  2007); its page on the AGPL says nothing about trained models. Ultralytics' own statements, as reported by search summaries on
  2026-10-08 (its license FAQ and request-a-license page, a maintainer's comment in a GitHub issue, and Roboflow, a licensor of
  Ultralytics and a commercial party): trained and fine-tuned models, "even if you train your own model from scratch" and use it
  only internally, fall under AGPL-3.0 unless an Enterprise License is obtained, and downstream code that includes the training code
  or a model should be open-sourced. Whether a court would agree is disputed (a commenter in the same issue argues custom-trained
  models are not covered). The primary pages were not read (the AGPL page on ultralytics.com has no such text; the FAQ and
  Enterprise terms were not retrieved). Meaning for this project: weights trained with ultralytics should be treated as AGPL-3.0 if
  they are ever published (or the models retrained with a differently licensed trainer), and this repository's MIT licence does not
  extend over ultralytics code it imports. Counsel question; also the reason weights stay unpublished. Blender (used only to bake
  Rocketbox poses) is GPL software; that its outputs are not covered by the GPL was not checked here.

## Open items that need a person, not a search

- Fab EULA Section 16(l): confirmed in a browser by the owner on 2026-10-13. Still to re-read in a browser: Content License
  Agreement Sections 3 and 17 (read 2026-10-13 through curl only).
- Look up City Sample's NoAI tag status and agreement at the time of acquisition (purchase history).
- Acceptance dates and the licence version shown in the Epic account for City Sample and the Vehicle Variety Pack.
- Confirm the BDD100K licence on the official site (`doc.bdd100k.com` did not resolve; `bdd-data.berkeley.edu` failed its certificate
  check); read Ultralytics' license FAQ and Enterprise terms directly.
- Counsel: the NoAI tag and datasets, the MetaHuman clause (no longer used), Rocketbox's history and MIT's silence on ML (and,
  only if weights are ever released, BDD100K's commercial restriction and AGPL for the weights). Epic would not interpret any of it (reply of
  2026-10-08).

## What would change this record

- Section 16(l) of the Fab EULA (the definitions of NoAI Content and Generative AI Programs), and the acquisition dates of the Fab content.
- A written answer from Epic or counsel on the NoAI tag and the MetaHuman clause.
- Counsel's reading of the Rocketbox history.
- Verbatim licence text for Megascans, BDD100K, Cityscapes, RealDriveSim and ultralytics.
- A scene built entirely from permissively licensed vehicles, buildings and props (not scoped).
